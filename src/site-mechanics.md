# Site Mechanics

This [site source](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io) is an [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) instance, which is automatically deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) when Pull-Requests are merged.

This page describes the implementation of this deployment. Let me know if you find this helpful, or if you have issues / questions / improvements, please use [this site's issue tracker](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/issues).

## Design Goals

- Rendered content (anything generated by a program) should not be in revision control, because it's not source code. Typically humans shouldn't care about changes to rendered content unless they are diagnosing automation problems. By contrast, humans should definitely care about source, especially for a book.
- The book is automatically rendered to the public site whenever a PR is merged.

## Components

To achieve these goals, we have several components:

- We use a special purpose `gh-pages` branch that *does* contain rendered output. This should be the only exception. Other branches can have human-meaningful source.
- `mdbook` must be configured to render into `./docs` as a requirement of GitHub Pages: [book.toml](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/blob/8e77b8babaf681fa67cd08575a3b0d9dc8e85532/book.toml#L8-L10)
- We `.gitignore` the `./docs` dir, since this is rendered output, not human-meaningful source: [.gitignore](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/blob/8e77b8babaf681fa67cd08575a3b0d9dc8e85532/.gitignore#L1)
- We configure the GitHub repository to enable GitHub Page hosting.
- We add a `deploy.toml` GitHub Action which will deploy whenever we merge a PR to `main` branch: [.github/workflows/deploy.yaml](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/blob/f37628c2e9529562d8bed75974f8472706ee9631/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)

## Setting It Up

### Create and `mdbook`

See the [mdbook guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/creating.html) to get started.

### Configure `mdbook` and `.gitignore`

First we need to configure to render to `./docs` by adding this to [book.toml](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/blob/8e77b8babaf681fa67cd08575a3b0d9dc8e85532/book.toml#L8-L10):

```
[build]
# Follow gh pages convention:
build-dir = "./docs"
```

-and let's also ignore the render dir, because of our first design goal by adding this to [.gitignore](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/blob/8e77b8babaf681fa67cd08575a3b0d9dc8e85532/.gitignore#L1):

```
docs/
```

### Add the `deploy.yaml` GitHub Action

The [.github/workflows/deploy.yaml](https://github.com/nathan-at-least/nathan-at-least.github.io/blob/f37628c2e9529562d8bed75974f8472706ee9631/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) does all the good stuff. It:

- triggers on any push to `main` (the default repo branch),
- installs `mdbook`,
- checks out the source,
- renders the source with `mdbook`,
- removes `./docs` from `.gitignore` since this is the one exception to committing rendered content,
- disables `jekyll` (the standard GitHub Pages rendering system),
- and finally, commits and pushes the rendered content to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Configuring GitHub Pages

The final step is to tell GitHub Pages where to find the rendered site content:

- repo -> "Settings" -> "Pages"
- Set source to `gh-pages` branch. You may need to create this branch first; one way is by merging a PR to `main` to trigger the deploy action to produce your first render.
- Set the path to `./docs`.

### Fin.

Now you can edit the source of your site in a clean manner without the clutter of renderings. Enjoy!
